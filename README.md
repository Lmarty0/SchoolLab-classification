# SchoolLab-classification

It is believed that researchers who work together are more likely to co-author a scientific article or paper. Thus, to reorganise, we decided to create a graph where each researcher is associated with the lexical field that is found in his or her writings, which gives us information on the type of content he or she is associated with as well as his or her co-authorship links. 
After defining the laboratories we wanted and the researchers associated by default with these laboratories, we let the GCN associate the right laboratory with the others. 
This prototype is inspired by the work done on the CORA database. 

There are more details on the PDF linked with the project.
