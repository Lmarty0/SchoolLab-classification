The local SOVA uses the forward and backward state metric recursions just as the conventional Max-Log MAP (MLM) algorithm does\, and produces soft outputs using the SOVA update rules. The proposed local SOVA exhibits a lower computational complexity than the MLM algorithm when employed for high-radix decoding in order to increase throughput\, while having the same error correction performance even when used in a turbo decoding process. Furthermore\, with some simplifications\, it offers various trade-offs between error correction performance and computational complexity. Actually\, employing the local SOVA algorithm for radix-8 decoding of the LTE turbo code reduces the complexity by 33% without any performance degradation and by 36% with a slight penalty of only 0.05 dB. Moreover\, the local SOVA algorithm opens the door for the practical implementation of turbo decoders for radix-16 and higher. ",3,
203,243,Jean-Philippe Diguet,693792,jpdiguet,"A great deal of effort has recently been devoted to extending the usage of memristor technology from memory to computing. Memristor-based logic design is an emerging concept that targets efficient computing systems. Several logic families have evolved\, each with different attributes. Memristor Ratioed Logic (MRL) has been recently introduced as a hybrid memristor?CMOS logic family. MRL requires an efficient design strategy that takes into consideration the implementation phase. This paper presents a novel MRL-based crossbar design: X-MRL. The proposed structure combines the density and scalability attributes of memristive crossbar arrays and the opportunity of their implementation at the top of CMOS layer. The evaluation of the proposed approach is performed through the design of an X-MRL-based full adder. The design is presented with its layout and corresponding simulation results using the Cadence Virtuoso toolset and CMOS 65nm process. The comparison with a pure CMOS implementation is promising in terms of the area\, as our approach exhibits a 44.79% area reduction. Moreover\, the combined Energy.Delay metric demonstrates a significant improvement (between ž5.7 and ž31) with respect to the available literature.

205,245,Jean-Marc Le Caillec,942911,jmlecaillec,"Applications based on synergistic integration of optical imagery and LiDAR data are receiving a growing interest from the remote sensing community. However\, a misaligned integration between these datasets may fail to fully profit the potential of both sensors. In this regard\, an optimum fusion of optical imagery and LiDAR data requires an accurate registration. This is a complex problem since a versatile solution is still missing\, especially when considering the context where data are collected at different times\, from different platforms\, under different acquisition configurations. This paper presents a coarse-to-fine registration method of aerial/satellite optical imagery with airborne LiDAR data acquired in such context. Firstly\, a coarse registration involves extracting and matching of buildings from LiDAR data and optical imagery. Then\, a Mutual Information-based fine registration is carried out. It involves a super-resolution approach applied to LiDAR data\, and a local approach of transformation model estimation. The proposed method succeeds at overcoming the challenges associated with the aforementioned difficult context. Considering the experimented airborne LiDAR (2011) and orthorectified aerial imagery (2016) datasets\, their spatial shift is reduced by 48.15% after the proposed coarse registration. Moreover\, the incompatibility of size and spatial resolution is addressed by the mentioned super-resolution. Finally\, a high accuracy of dataset alignment is also achieved\, highlighted by a 40-cm error based on a check-point assessment and a 64-cm error based on a check-pair-line assessment. These promising results enable further Automatic extraction of buildings in urban and residential scenes has become a subject of growing interest in the domain of photogrammetry and remote sensing\, particularly since mid-1990s. Active contour model\, colloquially known as snake model\, has been studied to extract buildings from aerial and satellite imagery. However\, this task is still very challenging due to the complexity of building size\, shape\, and its surrounding environment. This complexity leads to a major obstacle for carrying out a reliable large-scale building extraction\, since the involved prior information and assumptions on building such as shape\, size\, and color cannot be generalized over large areas. This paper presents an efficient snake model to overcome such challenge\, called Super-Resolution-based Snake Model (SRSM). The SRSM operates on high-resolution LiDAR-based elevation images -- called z-images -- generated by a super-resolution process applied to LiDAR data. The involved balloon force model is also improved to shrink or inflate adaptively\, instead of inflating the snake continuously. This method is applicable for a large scale such as city scale and even larger\, while having a high level of automation and not requiring any prior knowledge nor training data from the urban scenes (hence unsupervised). It achieves high overall accuracy when tested on various datasets. For instance\, the proposed SRSM yields an average area-based Quality of 86.57% and object-based Quality of 81.60% on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark datasets. Compared to other methods using this benchmark dataset\, this level of accuracy is highly desirable even for a supervised method. Similarly desirable outcomes are obtained when carrying out the proposed SRSM on the whole City of Quebec (total area of 656 km2)\, yielding an area-based Quality of 62.37% and an object-based Quality of 63.21%. research for a complete versatile fusion methodology between airborne LiDAR and optical imagery data in this challenging context. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to estimate all the parameters of a Self Exited Threshold AutoRegressive (SETAR) model from an observed time series. The aim of this algorithm is to relax all the hypotheses concerning the SETAR model for instance\, the knowledge (or assumption) of the number of regimes\, the switching variables\, as well as of the switching function. For this\, we reverse the usual framework of SETAR model identification of the previous papers\, by first identifying the AR models using array clustering (instead of the switching variables and function) and second the switching conditions (instead of the AR models). The proposed algorithm is a pipeline of well-known algorithms in image/data processing allowing us to deal with the statistical non-stationarity of the observed time series. We pay a special attention on the results of each step over the possible discrepancies over the following step. Since we do not assume any SETAR model property\, asymptotical properties of the identification results are difficult to derive. Thus\, we validate our approach on several experiment sets. In order to assess the performance of our algorithm\, we introduce global metrics and ancillary metrics to validate each step of the proposed algorithm.",12,"777619,11588785"

They are able to distribute their workforce effectively without any central control\, using simple mechanisms based on stimuli (dances\, pheromones)\, interactions\, thresholds and feedback loops. Self-organisational concepts and some of those mechanisms\, like pheromones\, are invisible to the human eye. In order to help the user grasp the complexity of the task allocation\, we propose to make them visible in a virtual\, immersive and interactive environment. First\, this implies that the system must be able to simulate and display in real-time around 30 000 bees interacting with each other\, emitting clouds of pheromones. Secondly\, this implies also that the user should be able to alter in real-time the environment of the bees (e.g. by manipulating the frame of the hive) and visualise the effects on the organisation\, potentially days later. Finally\, we would like to give to biologists and beekeepers some domain-related\, intuitive and natural ways of interacting with the hive. We describe in this article these issues in more details\, and how we plan to tackle them.
